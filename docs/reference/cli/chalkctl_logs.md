# chalkctl logs

```sh
chalkctl logs <node> [flags]
```

Prints a node's journal of the current boot, of every unit or of --unit alone; with --follow it
keeps printing new entries until interrupted. The command needs a reader client file or the
secrets file. A node in maintenance mode is reached with --fingerprint or --insecure as well.

## Flags

| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--address`{ #flag-address } | string | the node's address in the inventory | Address of the node's chalkd, host or host:port. |
| `--config`{ #flag-config } | string | $CHALKOSCONFIG, else ~/.config/chalkos/config, unless --secrets is given | Client file to authenticate with instead of the secrets file. |
| `--fingerprint`{ #flag-fingerprint } | string | — | SHA-256 fingerprint the node prints on its console in maintenance mode. |
| `--follow`{ #flag-follow }, `-f` | boolean | `false` | Keep printing new entries. |
| `--identity`{ #flag-identity } | list of string | ~/.config/chalkos/age.key, ~/.ssh/id_ed25519, ~/.ssh/id_rsa | File holding an age identity to decrypt the secrets with; may be repeated. |
| `--insecure`{ #flag-insecure } | boolean | `false` | Accept any certificate and print the node's fingerprint. |
| `--inventory`{ #flag-inventory } | string | chalkos.yaml in the current directory, when it exists | Inventory naming the cluster's nodes, their addresses and their config files. |
| `--secrets`{ #flag-secrets } | string | — | Secrets file, encrypted with age or not, or - to read it from standard input. |
| `--unit`{ #flag-unit } | string | — | Unit whose entries alone are printed. |
